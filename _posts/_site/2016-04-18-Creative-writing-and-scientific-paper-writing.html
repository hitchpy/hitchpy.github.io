<p>Many people will agree with me that writing scientific manuscript is easier than creative writing. For papers, each section is clearly defined. You layout the background, list your contributions first, then <em>just</em> describe what you have done and how you did it. Related works will take some time, but you know what they have done, how their work differ from yours, so no big issues here.</p>

<p>Is it good that you can write your paper in a very engaging way? Of course! Here I would highly recommend every aspiring scientists to watch this fantastic 30 minutes video by Prof. Simon Peyton Jones about writing research paper.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dkRsTqdDA">Link</a></p>
