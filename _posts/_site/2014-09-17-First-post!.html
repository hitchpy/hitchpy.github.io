<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Letâ€™s face it, we all need to communicate our ideas with others. I started this page hoping that some of my thoughts/codes can reach out to more people and I can get more feedback from others.</p>

<p>To be a data scientist, you need to know a bunch of stuffs. And it takes time to be good at something. So the focus of the things that I do will mostly be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Data cleaning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application of Statistical/ Machine learning algorithms </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Details of algorithms/data structure implementations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some visualizations/result communications</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since I am trained as a statistician, <strong>R</strong> will be my primary language, but I speak <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
