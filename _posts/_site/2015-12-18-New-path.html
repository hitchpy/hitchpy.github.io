<p>Year 2015 is coming to an end. Now would be a good time to summarize what I have been doing recently, and talk a little bit more about what happens next(Spoiler, I am moving to Tennessee!).</p>

<p>Around August, I was in a state full of uncertainties. Projects on Kaggle are interesting but they are side projects - something to explore over the weekends when you have a <strong>job</strong>. There were a few things going on then: I decided to stay in the bioenergy project only to the end of this year; find data analyst/scientist jobs and go into industry; a PhD opportunity in high performance computing in University of Tennessee, Knoxville. </p>

<p>Finding job is a painful and time-consuming process, but if you set your mind to it, there are positions available. But even with a master degree, the job most likely will be basic data processing etc. On the other hand, the PhD program will be in a prestige research group, and there are large projects with important engineering and science questions to work on. I talked with several my friends and most of them have doubts about time investment in PhD, and location of the school(too “countryside”). Those are all valid concerns, but after some serious thoughts, I believe this is what I want to do and a choice I won’t regret. </p>

<p>With those cleared out of my mind, I focused on tying up everything here in the project and that is what I have been doing for the past few months. I need to write manuscript and publish the work we have done. Manuscript writing is something you need to practice to get good at, and I am definitely feeling the initial pain. Every procedure, analysis must be checked, everything need to be documented and well organized, and most importantly, I need to be patient. It is a long process: articulate the objective, perform necessary experiments to test hypothesis, interpret the result, write out the draft, find some errors, REPEAT… Finally we have our first draft ready to submit(yay!), let’s wait and see what will happen next.</p>

<p>With enough said about the past, let’s set some goals for 2016. My mentor has high hopes and expectations for me, and I do not plan to let him down. The transition from mostly writing scripts to analyze data to build efficient infrastructure for computation won’t be easy, fortunately, there will be many people in the new place to help(yes please!). My goal will be stay focused, and learn the things I need to accomplish the work.</p>

<p>New path lies ahead, and I ready for it.</p>
