<p>I have been looking for jobs recently because I am about to graduate soon. 
At the beginning of February, I have two interviews for the position of (junior) data scientist. Those are my first ever interviews. Although I didn’t get offer from either of them, it was a great experience. I would like to share some of the experiences here, and some thoughts about the process. Since there were non-disclosure agreements, I will not give out detail but only the general ideas. Hopefully someone might find this useful for their own future preparation.</p>

<p>It all began in the Engineering and Science career fair here at UC Davis around mid-Jan(quite awhile back already!). There are many tech companies but not so many have opening for data scientist position. I handed out about a dozen resumes and talked to the representatives about what I have done and why I am competent for the job. Naturally, they are all very polite and just told me to go back and wait for notice. Workday.inc provided a short interview opportunities that afternoon, and finally I was invited to have an onsite interview. The second interview was from Engage3, a startup here in Davis, focus on retailing. They called me a few days after the career fair. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Engage3
    <ul>
      <li>Called me, scheduled an hour informal interview with one of the senior member of the data scientist team.</li>
      <li>Talked with him in a coffee house, about what they are doing, what visions they have about their product, and what kinds of skills they would expect from their candidates. I had quite a nice conversation. Two days later they invited me for another two hour in-depth interview.</li>
      <li>The two hour interview includes two components, one is technical with two of the team members, the other one is behavioral. More details later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Workday
    <ul>
      <li>Mature company focus on enterprise software, especially in human management and financial management etc. Beautiful office in downtown SF. They are rapidly expanding their data science team, and they expect it will play an important role in their company’s decisions.</li>
      <li>During that short half hour on-campus interview, one of the senior member in the team interviewed me. It covered some basic statistical concepts, at the undergraduate level, and one SQL question, one data manipulation question. All quite standard. I didn’t ace it but I think I did ok. HR sent out an email for onsite a few days later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The term data scientist is widely used only in recently years and the role is not very well defined. Every companies have their own expectations, some more research oriented, some more software engineering related, some more like consulting etc.</p>

<h4 id="engage3">Engage3</h4>
<p>They were very straightforward and had clear idea about what their candidate should be able to do. They expect you know your conditional probability well(do it like a bayesian!), they also expect that you have strong hands on skill. I was given a piece of Python script to debug, since now I mostly use R for day to day analysis, it took me a while to spot the bug. No the usual kind of algorithm questions for software engineer position and that is nice. Fundamentally I think it is important that data scientist know those concepts but in it’s core, it is about analytics, the ability to explore data and yield insight from them. </p>

<p>On the behavioral site, they focus more on your personality, whether you can endure hardship(you can imagine the importance of the trait for a startup company). In hindsight, I should be more well prepared for this interview. Review the stat/probability concepts, and brush up my Python skill since most people outside stat would be more comfortable with Python/Java. They told me they will make the final decision next week and I got the rejection right on time.</p>

<p>Six round of interviews, the people there are all very talented. PhD from Physics/Stat/machine learning, experienced software engineers etc. First interview was about basic stat concepts again! <strong>Condition distribution</strong>, can’t stress that point more. Two of the them were coding style interviews. Need to write out the solution in a whiteboard, and yes, they would prefer you do it with Python/Java. The questions weren’t hard and I wrote out the solutions with Python with some hints. One of the interview was focused on machine learning algorithms, how they works, how to train them, their pros and cons. In conclusion, to do well in a data scientist interview, you need to know your ML toolbox well! And finally the head of the team talked with me for a moment, about what they are doing and their visions. </p>

<p>After that I also briefly interviewed with Cablevision and some other companies as well but still don’t have any offer yet. More hands on experiences are needed! </p>

<p>Next post I will talk about the Kaggle competition [BCI Challenge]{http://www.kaggle.com/c/inria-bci-challenge}. Which me and several my classmates joined and finally got 79 out of 270 teams.</p>
