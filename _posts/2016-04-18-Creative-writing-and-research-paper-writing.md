Many people will agree with me that writing scientific manuscript is easier than creative writing. For papers, each section is clearly defined. You layout the background, list your contributions first, then *just* describe what you have done and how you did it. Related works will take some time, but you know what they have done, how their work differ from yours, so no big issues here.

Is it good that you can write your paper in a very engaging way? Of course! Here I would highly recommend every aspiring scientists to watch this fantastic short presentation by Prof. Simon Peyton Jones about writing **great** research paper [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dkRsTqdDA). 

Turns out, much like novels, a research paper is telling a story too. You have already done a lot of good work, made some great discoveries, now you want to attract your readers with your convincing arguments and engaging descriptions. And that's where creative writing comes in. It trains you to emphasize the main story lines, create the necessary details while gloss over the unimportant parts. 

That's exactly what I have been doing lately, training myself to be a better writing by reading various novels. 

Some people might say: "No, Yu, this is just your way to justify reading that much novels!"

But I will reason with them: "Of course not, this blog post is a proof that my writing is definitely getting better."
