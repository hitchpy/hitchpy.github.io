### Introduction

Recently I have spend some time working on two Kaggle competition. One is a image classification problem [Diabetic Retinopathy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection), and one is context Ad click through rate(CTR) prediction [Avito Context Ad Clicks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-context-ad-clicks). 

Both are very interesting topics, but I didn't have enough time to explore the problem more deeply and the models are definitely suboptimal. Still, I have learned a few things from them.
