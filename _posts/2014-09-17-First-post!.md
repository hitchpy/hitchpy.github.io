# Introduction

Let's face it, we all need to communicate our ideas with others. I started this page hoping that some of my thoughts/codes can reach out to more people and I can get more feedback from others.

To be a data scientist, you need to know a bunch of stuffs. And it takes time to be good at something. So the focus of the things that I do will mostly be:

* Data cleaning

* Application of Statistical/ Machine learning algorithms 

* Details of algorithms/data structure implementations

* Some visualizations/result communications

Since I am trained as a statistician, **R** will be my primary language, but I speak **Python** and **C++** as well.

Enjoy!
