#About Me

Hello, you have reached Yu Pei's blog, where he talk about things in his life. I graduated from UC Davis (June, 2015) with a master degree in Biostatistics. Currently I am working as an intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, trying to enable in-situ capability for a climate simulation model. And this fall (August, 2016), I will be joining the Innovative Computing Laboratory at University of Tennessee, Knoxville as a Ph.D student.   

In my free time, I am active in Kaggle platform for various interesting data projects. 

I will try to keep my resume up to date, but you can always find me via my LinkedIn.
