#About Me

Hello, you have reached Yu Pei's blog, where I talk about things in my life. I graduated from UC Davis (June, 2015) with a master degree in Biostatistics. Currently I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the Innovative Computing Laboratory at University of Tennessee, Knoxville under the supervision of Jack Dongarra and Piotr Luszczek. I work closely with Dali Wang at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), focusing on large codebase understanding, simulation performance and in-situ data analysis.  

In my free time, I am active in Kaggle platform for various interesting data projects. 

I will try to keep my resume up to date, but you can always find my most current information through LinkedIn.
